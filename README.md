# Dekho: A Journey into Audio/Video Streaming

> **Announcement: ðŸ“¢** Dekho is back! After being a dead for nearly two years, we're reviving this project to explore the fundamentals of audio and video streaming once again. You can track our progress on the revival of the project in this milestone [here](https://github.com/Chirag-And-Dheeraj/video-streaming-server/milestone/1).

## Overview

Dekho is a research and study project aimed at understanding and mastering the intricacies of audio and video streaming. Our primary focus was on implementing the [HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)](https://developer.apple.com/streaming) protocol to build an on-demand live streaming server.

However, expect things to change in the upcoming versions while we shape this into something more refined.

## Key Resources

Our journey has been greatly enriched by the insights and guidance from various resources. A pivotal article that set us on the right path is "[Learning the basics of video streaming with Golang](https://www.rohitmundra.com/video-streaming-server)" by [Rohit Mundra](https://twitter.com/brohit3).

For a comprehensive list of resources that have been instrumental in our learning and development process, please refer to our [documentation](https://github.com/Chirag-And-Dheeraj/video-streaming-server/blob/main/documentation/video-streaming-project-stuff/links.md).
