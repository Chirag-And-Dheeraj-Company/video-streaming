Respected Dr. Fei-Fei Li

I am Dheeraj Lalwani an Computer Engineering Undergraduate student studying at the University of Mumbai. I am a part of a small tech community: Our Tech Community: https://ourtech.community based out of Mumbai, India.

We are a diverse group of people with varied backgrounds in tech with AI and Machine Learning being one of them. We really find your work inspiring and would like to invite you for an online interactive session to talk about some of the work you do followed by a QnA session. Our community would highly appreciate your presence.

Please do reply at the same email if you are interested in doing something like this. We usually conduct our CatchUp sessions 10:30 PM (Indian Standard Time) which is 10:00 AM (Pacific Time) but we can always workout the date and time as per your preferences. You can read the summaries of some of our older sessions below:

Looking forward to hear from you.

Thank you!
