# Initial Research

## Streaming Protocol
Options were: RTMP, RTSP, HLS, MPEG-DASH, MSS, SRT, WebRTC
We currently chose HLS because of it's WIDE range of compatiaility with various platforms, especially because Apple devices only support HLS.

## Video  Codec
There is no other option other than AVC (H.264) because  HLS supports only AVC. But it is a very commonly used codec. H.264 works with multiple container formats, including MP4, TS, and MOV.
